# CVE Research: MS17-010 (CVE-2017-0144)

## 1. What is the CVE ID for the vulnerability?
The CVE ID is **CVE-2017-0144**.

## 2. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability.
The SMBv1 server in Microsoft Windows allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted packets. This is caused by how the Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) server handles certain requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the ability to execute code on the target server.

## 3. What is the CVSS score for this vulnerability?
* **CVSS v3.x Base Score:** 9.8 (CRITICAL)
* **Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

## 4. What are the potential impacts of exploiting this vulnerability?
The impact is **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. Because the vulnerability exists in a service running with SYSTEM privileges (the kernel-level SMB driver), an attacker can:
* Gain full control over the target system.
* Install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
* Spread "wormable" malware (like WannaCry or NotPetya) automatically to other vulnerable machines on the network without user interaction.

## 5. Are there any known mitigations or patches available for this vulnerability?
* **Security Update:** Microsoft released the **MS17-010** security update in March 2017 which patches the flaw.
* **Workaround:** Disable SMBv1 protocol on all systems (it is an outdated and insecure protocol).
* **Network Security:** Block ports 139 and 445 at the network perimeter to prevent external exploitation.
